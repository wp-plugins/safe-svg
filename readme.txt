Allow SVG uploads and sanitize them to stop XML/SVG vulnerabilities

== Description ==

Safe SVG gives you the ability to allow SVG uploads in WordPress and make sure that they're sanitized to stop SVG/XML vulnerabilities affecting your site.

This is more of a proof of concept for [#24251](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251) than anything but feel free to use it!

SVG Sanitization is done through the following library: [https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer)

== Installation ==

Install through the WordPress directory or download, unzip and upload the files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
